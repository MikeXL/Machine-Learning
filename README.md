Learning Machine Learning

Desipte the popularity and the rise of the machine learning, there still just handful of algo that people can go with, be it supervised or not.
When was last time you heard the new algo introduced to the world, yes, amazon had the "customer also bought" affinity analysis or association rules,
and netflix has it "here is for you" famous recommender. That is probably about it. Everyone else like me, we just pick few algo, run for it.

Neuro network? forget it, if machine could think like we think, then their margin of error would just be as the same as humans, if not worse.


Wanna know how your algo perform?

RMSE

Cross Validation

accuracy, easier to calculate for an supervised algo, as you do have the test data set.
