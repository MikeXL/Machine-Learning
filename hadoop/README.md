hadoop and machine learning
=====
First of all, welcome to the exciting landscape of big data and machine learning. And now your life sucks!
Here is why, be it, R, scikit-learn, even sas, or some other data mining, machine learning tools out there, they are there for a long period of time, and long before the phenomenon of hadoop, or so called _big data_. Therefore, those tools were not designed to be run in parallel or in a distributed environment.

Now, how can we run them in parallel? Very good question.

## h2o


## spark


## hadoop streaming

## revolution R


bonus, sas does have distributed in-memory computing product named lasr, that is running inside hadoop. don't know how much $ people need to throw to embrace it.
